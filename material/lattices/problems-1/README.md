# Lattice-based Cryptography – Problem Session 1

Make use of the provided Python templates to:

1. Implement the Encryption scheme
   
   * $p = 257$
   * Dimensions of $A = 64 × 64$
   * distribution of $s, e, r, e₁, e₂$ is Binomial: i.e. each coefficient is $b₀ + b₁ - b₂ - b₃$ ($b_i$ are bits)

2. Write a script to compute the decryption error
